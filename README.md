I used the Mall Customers dataset in Kaggle  and applied DBSCAN clustering. 
The dataset contains customer data like annual income and spending score, which is great for clustering customers into segments.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm in machine learning. 
It identifies clusters based on the density of data points in a region. 
It can be particularly useful for datasets with irregular shapes and noise.
The data source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers
The following results were found
Number of clusters: 2
Number of noise points: 8
Silhouette Score: 0.426
